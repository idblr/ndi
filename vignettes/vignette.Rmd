Set your U.S. Census Bureau access key. Follow [this link](http://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html) to obtain one. Specify your access key in the `messer()` or `powell_wiley()` functions using the `key` argument of the `get_acs()` function from the `tidycensus` package called within each or by using the `census_api_key()` function from the `tidycensus` package before running the `messer()` or `powell_wiley()` functions (see an example of the latter below).

```{r access_key_private, echo = FALSE}
source("../dev/private_key.R")
tidycensus::census_api_key(private_key)
```

```{r access_key_public, eval = FALSE}
tidycensus::census_api_key("...") # INSERT YOUR OWN KEY FROM U.S. CENSUS API

### Compute NDI (Messer)

Compute the NDI (Messer) values (2006-2010 5-year ACS) for Georgia, U.S.A., census tracts. This metric is based on [Messer et al. (2006)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11524-006-9094-x) with the following socio-economic status (SES) variables: 

| Characteristic | SES dimension | ACS table source | Description |
| -------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| OCC | Occupation | C24030 | Percent males in management, science, and arts occupation |
| CWD | Housing | B25014 | Percent of crowded housing |
| POV | Poverty | B17017 | Percent of households in poverty |
| FHH | Poverty | B25115 | Percent of female headed households with dependents |
| PUB | Poverty | B19058 | Percent of households on public assistance |
| U30 | Poverty | B19001 | Percent households earning <$30,000 per year |
| EDU | Education | B06009 | Percent earning less than a high school education |
| EMP | Employment | B23001 (2010 only); B23025 (2011 onward) | Percent unemployed |

```{r messer, results = 'hide'}
messer2010GA <- ndi::messer(state = "GA", year = 2010, round_output = TRUE)
```

One output from the `messer()` function is a tibble containing the identification, geographic name, NDI (Messer) values, and raw census characteristics for each tract.

```{r messer_out1}
messer2010GA$ndi
```

A second output from the `messer()` function is the results from the principal component analysis used to compute the NDI (Messer) values.

```{r messer_out2}
messer2010GA$pca
```

A third output from the `messer()` function is a tibble containing a breakdown of the missingness of the census characteristics used to compute the NDI (Messer) values.

```{r messer_out3}
messer2010GA$missing
```

We can visualize the NDI (Messer) values geographically by linking them to spatial information from the `tigris` package and plotting with the `ggplot2` package suite.

```{r messer_prep, results = 'hide'}
# Obtain the 2010 counties from the "tigris" package
county2010GA <- tigris::counties(state = "GA", year = 2010, cb = TRUE)
# Remove first 9 characters from GEOID for compatibility with tigris information
county2010GA$GEOID <- substring(county2010GA$GEO_ID, 10) 

# Obtain the 2010 census tracts from the "tigris" package
tract2010GA <- tigris::tracts(state = "GA", year = 2010, cb = TRUE)
# Remove first 9 characters from GEOID for compatibility with tigris information
tract2010GA$GEOID <- substring(tract2010GA$GEO_ID, 10) 

# Join the NDI (Messer) values to the census tract geometry
GA2010messer <- dplyr::left_join(tract2010GA, messer2010GA$ndi, by = "GEOID")
```

### Compute NDI (Powell-Wiley)

Compute the NDI (Powell-Wiley) values (2016-2020 5-year ACS) for Maryland, Virginia, Washington, D.C., and West Virginia, U.S.A., census tracts. This metric is based on [Andrews et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1080/17445647.2020.1750066) and [Slotman et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2022.108002) with socio-economic status (SES) variables chosen by [Roux and Mair (2010)](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.05333.x):

| Characteristic | SES dimension | ACS table source | Description |
| -------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| MedHHInc | Wealth and income | B19013 | Median household income (dollars) |
| PctRecvIDR | Wealth and income | B19054 | Percent of households receiving dividends, interest, or rental income |
| PctPubAsst | Wealth and income | B19058 | Percent of households receiving public assistance |
| MedHomeVal | Wealth and income | B25077 | Median home value (dollars) |
| PctMgmtBusSciArt | Occupation | C24060 | Percent in a management, business, science, or arts occupation |

More information about the [codebook](https://gis.cancer.gov/research/NeighDeprvIndex_Methods.pdf) and [computation](https://gis.cancer.gov/research/NeighDeprvIndex_Methods.pdf) of the NDI (Powell-Wiley) can be found on a [GIS Portal for Cancer Research](https://gis.cancer.gov/research/files.html#soc-dep) website.

```{r powell_wiley, results = 'hide'}
powell_wiley2020DMVW <- ndi::powell_wiley(state = c("DC", "MD", "VA", "WV"), year = 2020, round_output = TRUE)
```

One output from the `powell_wiley()` function is a tibble containing the identification, geographic name, NDI (Powell-Wiley) values, and raw census characteristics for each tract.

```{r powell_wiley_out1}
powell_wiley2020DMVW$ndi
```

A second output from the `powell_wiley()` function is the results from the principal component analysis used to compute the NDI (Powell-Wiley) values.

```{r powell_wiley_out2}
powell_wiley2020DMVW$pca
```

A third output from the `powell_wiley()` function is a tibble containing a breakdown of the missingness of the census characteristics used to compute the NDI (Powell-Wiley) values.

```{r powell_wiley_out3}
powell_wiley2020DMVW$missing
```

A fourth output from the `powell_wiley()` function is a character string or numeric value of a standardized Cronbach's alpha. A value greater than 0.7 is desired.

```{r powell_wiley_out4}
powell_wiley2020DMVW$cronbach
```

We can visualize the NDI (Powell-Wiley) values geographically by linking them to spatial information from the `tigris` package and plotting with the `ggplot2` package suite.

```{r powell_wiley_prep, results = 'hide'}

                   subtitle = "DC, MD, VA, and WV tracts as the referent")

Like the NDI (Messer), we also compute county-level NDI (Powell-Wiley).

```{r powell_wiley_county_prep, results = 'hide'}
# Obtain the 2020 counties from the "tigris" package
county2020DMVW <- tigris::counties(state = c("DC", "MD", "VA", "WV"), year = 2020, cb = TRUE)

### Advanced Features

#### Imputing missing census variables

In the `messer()` and `powell_wiley()` functions, missing census characteristics can be imputed using the `missing` and `impute` arguments of the `pca()` function in the `psych` package called within the `messer()` and `powell_wiley()` functions. Impute values using the logical `imp` argument (currently only calls `impute = "median"` by default, which assigns the median values of each missing census variable for a geography).

```{r powell_wiley_imp, results = 'hide'}
powell_wiley2020DC <- ndi::powell_wiley(state = "DC", year = 2020) # without imputation
powell_wiley2020DCi <- ndi::powell_wiley(state = "DC", year = 2020, imp = TRUE) # with imputation

table(is.na(powell_wiley2020DC$ndi$NDI)) # n=13 tracts without NDI (Powell-Wiley) values
table(is.na(powell_wiley2020DCi$ndi$NDI)) # n=0 tracts without NDI (Powell-Wiley) values

# Obtain the 2020 census tracts from the "tigris" package
tract2020DC <- tigris::tracts(state = "DC", year = 2020, cb = TRUE)

# Join the NDI (Powell-Wiley) values to the census tract geometry
DC2020pw <- dplyr::left_join(tract2020DC, powell_wiley2020DC$ndi, by = "GEOID")
DC2020pw <- dplyr::left_join(DC2020pw, powell_wiley2020DCi$ndi, by = "GEOID", suffix = c("_nonimp", "_imp"))

#### Assign the referent (U.S.-Standardized Metric)

To conduct a contiguous US-standardized index, compute an NDI for all states as in the example below that replicates the nationally standardized NDI (Powell-Wiley) values (2013-2017 ACS-5) found in [Slotman et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2022.108002) and available from a [GIS Portal for Cancer Research](https://gis.cancer.gov/research/files.html#soc-dep) website. To replicate the nationally standardized NDI (Powell-Wiley) values (2006-2010 ACS-5) found in [Andrews et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1080/17445647.2020.1750066) change the `year` argument to `2010` (i.e., `year = 2010`).

```{r national_prep, results = 'hide'}
us <- tigris::states()
n51 <- c("Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands", "Guam", "American Samoa",
         "Puerto Rico", "United States Virgin Islands")
y51 <- us$STUSPS[!(us$NAME %in% n51)]

start_time <- Sys.time() # record start time
powell_wiley2017US <- ndi::powell_wiley(state = y51, year = 2017)
end_time <- Sys.time() # record end time
time_srr <- end_time - start_time # Calculate run time
```

```{r national_hist, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7}
ggplot2::ggplot(powell_wiley2017US$ndi, 
                ggplot2::aes(x = NDI)) +
  ggplot2::geom_histogram(color = "black",
                          fill = "white") + 
  ggplot2::theme_minimal() +
  ggplot2::ggtitle("Histogram of US-standardized NDI (Powell-Wiley) values (2013-2017)",
                   subtitle = "U.S. census tracts as the referent (including AK, HI, and DC)")
```

The process to compute a US-standardized NDI (Powell-Wiley) took about `r round(time_srr, digits = 1)` minutes to run on a machine with the features listed at the end of the vignette.

#### Compute Racial Isolation Index (RI)

Compute the spatial RI  values (2006-2010 5-year ACS) for North Carolina, U.S.A., census tracts. This metric is based on [Anthopolos et al. (2011)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sste.2011.06.002) that assessed the racial isolation of the population that identifies as non-Hispanic or Latino, Black or African American alone. Multiple racial/ethnic subgroups are available in the `anthopolos()` function, including:

| ACS table source | racial/ethnic subgroup | character for `subgroup` argument |
| -------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| B03002_002 | not Hispanic or Latino | NHoL |
| B03002_003 | not Hispanic or Latino, white alone | NHoLW |
| B03002_004 | not Hispanic or Latino, Black or African American alone | NHoLB |

| B03002_016 | Hispanic or Latino, Asian alone | HoLA |
| B03002_017 | Hispanic or Latino, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander alone | HoLNHOPI |
| B03002_018 | Hispanic or Latino, some other race alone | HoLSOR |

| B03002_021 | Hispanic or Latino, two races excluding some other race, and three or more races | HoLTReSOR |

A census geography (and its neighbors) that has nearly all of its population who identify with the specified race/ethnicity subgroup(s) (e.g., Not Hispanic or Latino, Black or African American alone) will have an RI value close to 1. In contrast, a census geography (and its neighbors) that is nearly none of its population who identify with the specified race/ethnicity subgroup(s) (e.g., not Not Hispanic or Latino, Black or African American alone) will have an RI value close to 0.

```{r anthopolos_prep, results = 'hide'}
anthopolos2010NC <- ndi::anthopolos(state = "NC", year = 2010, subgroup = "NHoLB")

# Obtain the 2010 census tracts from the "tigris" package

```

The current version of the `ndi` package does not correct for edge effects (e.g., census geographies along the specified spatial extent border, coastline, or U.S.-Mexico / U.S.-Canada border) may have few neighboring census geographies, and RI values in these census geographies may be unstable. A stop-gap solution for the former source of edge effect is to compute the RI for neighboring census geographies (i.e., the states bordering a study area of interest) and then use the estimates of the study area of interest.

```{r anthopolos_edge_prep, results = 'hide'}
# Compute RI for all census tracts in neighboring states
anthopolos2010GNSTV <- ndi::anthopolos(state = c("GA", "NC", "SC", "TN", "VA"),
                                     year = 2010, subgroup = "NHoLB")

# Crop to only North Carolina, U.S.A. census tracts
anthopolos2010NCe <- anthopolos2010GNSTV$ri[anthopolos2010GNSTV$ri$GEOID %in% anthopolos2010NC$ri$GEOID, ]

# Obtain the 2010 census tracts from the "tigris" package
tract2010NC <- tigris::tracts(state = "NC", year = 2010, cb = TRUE)
# Remove first 9 characters from GEOID for compatibility with tigris information
tract2010NC$GEOID <- substring(tract2010NC$GEO_ID, 10) 

# Obtain the 2010 counties from the "tigris" package
county2010NC <- tigris::counties(state = "NC", year = 2010, cb = TRUE)

# Join the RI values to the census tract geometry
edgeNC2010anthopolos <- dplyr::left_join(tract2010NC, anthopolos2010NCe, by = "GEOID")
```

```{r anthopolos_edge_plot, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 7}

#### Compute Educational Isolation Index (EI)

Compute the spatial EI (Bravo) values (2006-2010 5-year ACS) for North Carolina, U.S.A., census tracts. This metric is based on [Bravo et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179384) that assessed the educational isolation of the population without a four-year college degree. Multiple educational attainment categories are available in the `bravo()` function, including:

| ACS table source | educational attainment category | character for `subgroup` argument |
| -------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| B06009_002 | less than high school graduate | LtHS |
| B06009_003 | high school graduate (includes equivalency) | HSGiE |
| B06009_004 | some college or associate's degree | SCoAD |
| B06009_005 | Bachelor's degree | BD |
| B06009_006 | graduate or professional degree | GoPD |
Note: The ACS-5 data (2005-2009) uses the "B15002" question.

A census geography (and its neighbors) that has nearly all of its population with the specified educational attainment category (e.g., a four-year college degree or more) will have an EI (Bravo) value close to 1. In contrast, a census geography (and its neighbors) that is nearly none of its population with the specified educational attainment category (e.g., with a four-year college degree) will have an EI (Bravo) value close to 0.

```{r bravo_prep, results = 'hide'}
bravo2010NC <- ndi::bravo(state = "NC", year = 2010, subgroup = c("LtHS", "HSGiE", "SCoAD"))

# Obtain the 2010 census tracts from the "tigris" package
tract2010NC <- tigris::tracts(state = "NC", year = 2010, cb = TRUE)
# Remove first 9 characters from GEOID for compatibility with tigris information
tract2010NC$GEOID <- substring(tract2010NC$GEO_ID, 10) 

# Obtain the 2010 counties from the "tigris" package
county2010NC <- tigris::counties(state = "NC", year = 2010, cb = TRUE)

# Join the EI (Bravo) values to the census tract geometry
NC2010bravo <- dplyr::left_join(tract2010NC, bravo2010NC$ei, by = "GEOID")
```

```{r bravo_plot, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 7}
# Visualize the EI (Bravo) values (2006-2010 5-year ACS) for North Carolina, U.S.A., census tracts 
ggplot2::ggplot() + 
  ggplot2::geom_sf(data = NC2010bravo, 
                   ggplot2::aes(fill = EI),
                   size = 0.05,
                   color = "transparent") +
   ggplot2::geom_sf(data = county2010NC,
                   fill = "transparent", 
                   color = "white",
                   size = 0.2) +
  ggplot2::theme_minimal() +
  ggplot2::scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  ggplot2::labs(fill = "Index (Continuous)",
                caption = "Source: U.S. Census ACS 2006-2010 estimates") +
  ggplot2::ggtitle("Educational Isolation Index (Bravo), without a four-year college degree",
                   subtitle = "NC census tracts (not corrected for edge effects)")
```

Can correct one source of edge effect in the same manner as shown for the RI metric.

#### Retrieve the Gini Index

Retrieve the aspatial Gini Index values (2006-2010 5-year ACS) for North Carolina, U.S.A., census tracts. This metric is based on [Gini (1921)](https://doi.org/10.2307/2223319), and the `gini()` function retrieves the estimate from the ACS-5. 

According to the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://census.gov/topics/income-poverty/income-inequality/about/metrics/gini-index.html): "The Gini Index is a summary measure of income inequality. The Gini coefficient incorporates the detailed shares data into a single statistic, which summarizes the dispersion of income across the entire income distribution. The Gini coefficient ranges from 0, indicating perfect equality (where everyone receives an equal share), to 1, perfect inequality (where only one recipient or group of recipients receives all the income). The Gini is based on the difference between the Lorenz curve (the observed cumulative income distribution) and the notion of a perfectly equal income distribution."

```{r gini_prep, results = 'hide'}
gini2010NC <- ndi::gini(state = "NC", year = 2010)

# Obtain the 2010 census tracts from the "tigris" package
tract2010NC <- tigris::tracts(state = "NC", year = 2010, cb = TRUE)
# Remove first 9 characters from GEOID for compatibility with tigris information
tract2010NC$GEOID <- substring(tract2010NC$GEO_ID, 10) 

# Obtain the 2010 counties from the "tigris" package
county2010NC <- tigris::counties(state = "NC", year = 2010, cb = TRUE)

# Join the Gini Index values to the census tract geometry
NC2010gini <- dplyr::left_join(tract2010NC, gini2010NC$gini, by = "GEOID")
```

```{r gini_plot, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 7}

```

### Index of Concentration at the Extremes (ICE)

Compute the aspatial Index of Concentration at the Extremes values (2006-2010 5-year ACS) for Wayne County, Michigan, U.S.A., census tracts. Wayne County is the home of Detroit, Michigan, a highly segregated city in the U.S. This metric is based on [Feldman et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2015-205728) and [Krieger et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2015.302955) who expanded the metric designed by Massey in a chapter of [Booth & Crouter (2001)](https://doi.org/10.4324/9781410600141) initially designed for residential segregation. The `krieger()` function computes five ICE metrics using the following ACS-5 groups:

| ACS table group | ICE metric | Comparison
| -------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| B19001 | Income, "ICE_inc"| 80th income percentile vs. 20th income percentile |
| B15002 | Education, "ICE_edu"| less than high school vs. four-year college degree or more |
| B03002 | Race/Ethnicity, "ICE_rewb"| 80th income percentile vs. 20th income percentile |
| B19001 & B19001B & B19001H | Income and race/ethnicity combined, "ICE_wbinc" | white non-Hispanic in 80th income percentile vs. black alone (including Hispanic) in 20th income percentile |
| B19001 & B19001H | Income and race/ethnicity combined, "ICE_wpcinc"| white non-Hispanic in 80th income percentile vs. white non-Hispanic in 20th income percentile |

ICE metrics can range in value from −1 (most deprived) to 1 (most privileged). A value of 0 can thus represent two possibilities: (1) none of the residents are in the most privileged or most deprived categories, or (2) an equal number of persons are in the most privileged and most deprived categories, and in both cases indicates that the area is not dominated by extreme concentrations of either of the two groups.

#### Compute racial/ethnic Dissimilarity Index (DI)

Compute the aspatial racial/ethnic DI values (2006-2010 5-year ACS) for Pennsylvania, U.S.A., counties from census tracts. This metric is based on [Duncan & Duncan (1955)](https://doi.org/10.2307/2088328) that assessed the racial/ethnic isolation of students that identify as non-Hispanic or Latino, Black or African American alone compared to students that identify as non-Hispanic or Latino, white alone between schools and school districts. Multiple racial/ethnic subgroups are available in the `duncan()` function, including:

| ACS table source | racial/ethnic subgroup | character for `subgroup` or `subgroup_ref` arguments |
| -------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| B03002_002 | not Hispanic or Latino | NHoL |

DI is a measure of the evenness of racial/ethnic residential segregation when comparing smaller geographical areas to larger ones within which the smaller geographical areas are located. DI can range in value from 0 to 1 and represents the proportion of racial/ethnic subgroup members that would have to change their area of residence to achieve an even distribution within the larger geographical area under conditions of maximum segregation.

```{r duncan_prep, results = 'hide'}
duncan2010PA <- ndi::duncan(geo_large = "county", geo_small = "tract", state = "PA",
                            year = 2010, subgroup = "NHoLB", subgroup_ref = "NHoLW")

# Obtain the 2010 census counties from the "tigris" package
county2010PA <- tigris::counties(state = "PA", year = 2010, cb = TRUE)

#### Compute aspatial income or racial/ethnic Atkinson Index (AI)

Compute the aspatial income or racial/ethnic AI values (2017-2021 5-year ACS) for Kentucky, U.S.A., counties from census block groups. This metric is based on [Atkinson (1970)](https://doi.org/10.2307/2088328) that assessed the distribution of income within 12 counties but has since been adapted to study racial/ethnic segregation (see [James & Taeuber 1985](https://doi.org/10.2307/270845)). To compare median household income, specify `subgroup = "MedHHInc"` which will use the ACS-5 variable "B19013_001" in the computation. Multiple racial/ethnic subgroups are available in the `atkinson()` function, including:

| ACS table source | racial/ethnic subgroup | character for `subgroup` argument |
| -------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| B03002_002 | not Hispanic or Latino | NHoL |
| B03002_003 | not Hispanic or Latino, white alone | NHoLW |
| B03002_004 | not Hispanic or Latino, Black or African American alone | NHoLB |

AI is a measure of the inequality and, in the context of residential race/ethnicity, segregation when comparing smaller geographical areas to larger ones within which the smaller geographical areas are located. AI can range in value from 0 to 1 and smaller values of the index indicate lower levels of inequality (e.g., less segregation).

AI is sensitive to the choice of `epsilon` argument or the shape parameter that determines how to weight the increments to inequality (segregation) contributed by different proportions of the Lorenz curve. A user must explicitly decide how heavily to weight smaller geographical units at different points on the Lorenz curve (i.e., whether the index should take greater account of differences among areas of over- or under-representation). The `epsilon` argument must have values between 0 and 1.0. For `0 <= epsilon < 0.5` or less "inequality-averse," smaller geographical units with a subgroup proportion smaller than the subgroup proportion of the larger geographical unit contribute more to inequality ("over-representation"). For `0.5 < epsilon <= 1.0` or more "inequality-averse," smaller geographical units with a subgroup proportion larger than the subgroup proportion of the larger geographical unit contribute more to inequality ("under-representation"). If `epsilon = 0.5` (the default), units of over- and under-representation contribute equally to the index. See Section 2.3 of [Saint-Jacques et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2002.05819) for one method to select `epsilon`. We choose `epsilon = 0.67` in the example below:

```{r atkinson_prep, results = 'hide'}
atkinson2021KY <- ndi::atkinson(geo_large = "county", geo_small = "block group", state = "KY",
                                year = 2021, subgroup = "NHoLB", epsilon = 0.67)

# Obtain the 2021 census counties from the "tigris" package
county2021KY <- tigris::counties(state = "KY", year = 2021, cb = TRUE)

# Join the AI values to the county geometry
KY2021atkinson <- dplyr::left_join(county2021KY, atkinson2021KY$ai, by = "GEOID")

V removes the asymmetry from the Isolation Index by controlling for the effect of population composition when comparing smaller geographical areas to larger ones within which the smaller geographical areas are located. The Isolation Index is some measure of the probability that a member of one subgroup(s) will meet or interact with a member of another subgroup(s) with higher values signifying higher probability of interaction (less isolation). V can range in value from 0 to 1.

LQ is some measure of relative racial homogeneity of each smaller geography within a larger geography. LQ can range in value from 0 to infinity because it is ratio of two proportions in which the numerator is the proportion of subgroup population in a smaller geography and the denominator is the proportion of subgroup population in its larger geography. For example, a smaller geography with an LQ of 5 means that the proportion of the subgroup population living in the smaller geography is five times the proportion of the subgroup population in its larger geography. Unlike the previous metrics that aggregate to the larger geography, LQ computes values for each smaller geography relative to the larger geography.

#### Compute Local Exposure and Isolation (LEx/Is)

Compute the aspatial racial/ethnic Local Exposure and Isolation metric (2017-2021 5-year ACS) for Kentucky, U.S.A., counties vs. the state. This metric is based on [Bemanian & Beyer (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-16-0926). Multiple racial/ethnic subgroups are available in the `bemanian_beyer()` function, including:

| ACS table source | racial/ethnic subgroup | character for `subgroup` argument |
| -------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| B03002_002 | not Hispanic or Latino | NHoL |
| B03002_003 | not Hispanic or Latino, white alone | NHoLW |
| B03002_004 | not Hispanic or Latino, Black or African American alone | NHoLB |
| B03002_005 | not Hispanic or Latino, American Indian and Alaska Native alone | NHoLAIAN |
| B03002_006 | not Hispanic or Latino, Asian alone | NHoLA |
| B03002_007 | not Hispanic or Latino, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone | NHoLNHOPI |
| B03002_008 | not Hispanic or Latino, some other race alone | NHoLSOR |
| B03002_009 | not Hispanic or Latino, two or more races | NHoLTOMR |
| B03002_010 | not Hispanic or Latino, two races including some other race | NHoLTRiSOR |
| B03002_011 | not Hispanic or Latino, two races excluding some other race, and three or more races | NHoLTReSOR |

LEx/Is is a measure of the probability that two individuals living within a specific smaller geography (e.g., census tract) of either different (i.e., exposure) or the same (i.e., isolation) racial/ethnic subgroup(s) will interact, assuming that individuals within a smaller geography are randomly mixed. LEx/Is is standardized with a logit transformation and centered against an expected case that all races/ethnicities are evenly distributed across a larger geography. LEx/Is can range from negative infinity to infinity. If LEx/Is is zero then the estimated probability of the interaction between two people of the given subgroup(s) within a smaller geography is equal to the expected probability if the subgroup(s) were perfectly mixed in the larger geography. If LEx/Is is greater than zero then the interaction is more likely to occur within the smaller geography than in the larger geography, and if LEx/Is is less than zero then the interaction is less likely to occur within the smaller geography than in the larger geography. Note: the exponentiation of each LEx/Is metric results in the odds ratio of the specific exposure or isolation of interest in a smaller geography relative to the larger geography. Similar to LQ (Sudano), LEx/Is computes values for each smaller geography relative to the larger geography.
