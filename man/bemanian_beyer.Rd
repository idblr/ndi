\description{
Compute the aspatial Local Exposure and Isolation (Bemanian & Beyer) metric of a selected racial/ethnic subgroup(s) and U.S. geographies.
}
\details{
This function will compute the aspatial Local Exposure and Isolation (\emph{LEx/Is}) metric of selected racial/ethnic subgroups and U.S. geographies for a specified geographical extent (e.g., the entire U.S. or a single state) based on Bemanian & Beyer (2017) \doi{10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-16-0926}. This function provides the computation of \emph{LEx/Is} for any of the U.S. Census Bureau race/ethnicity subgroups (including Hispanic and non-Hispanic individuals).

The function uses the \code{\link[tidycensus]{get_acs}} function to obtain U.S. Census Bureau 5-year American Community Survey characteristics used for the aspatial computation. The yearly estimates are available for 2009 onward when ACS-5 data are available (2010 onward for \code{geo_large = 'cbsa'}) but may be available from other U.S. Census Bureau surveys. The twenty racial/ethnic subgroups (U.S. Census Bureau definitions) are:
\itemize{
\item \strong{B03002_002}: not Hispanic or Latino \code{'NHoL'}
\item \strong{B03002_003}: not Hispanic or Latino, white alone \code{'NHoLW'}
\item \strong{B03002_004}: not Hispanic or Latino, Black or African American alone \code{'NHoLB'}
\item \strong{B03002_005}: not Hispanic or Latino, American Indian and Alaska Native alone \code{'NHoLAIAN'}
\item \strong{B03002_006}: not Hispanic or Latino, Asian alone \code{'NHoLA'}
\item \strong{B03002_007}: not Hispanic or Latino, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone \code{'NHoLNHOPI'}
\item \strong{B03002_008}: not Hispanic or Latino, Some other race alone \code{'NHoLSOR'}
\item \strong{B03002_009}: not Hispanic or Latino, Two or more races \code{'NHoLTOMR'}
\item \strong{B03002_010}: not Hispanic or Latino, Two races including Some other race \code{'NHoLTRiSOR'}
\item \strong{B03002_011}: not Hispanic or Latino, Two races excluding Some other race, and three or more races \code{'NHoLTReSOR'}
\item \strong{B03002_012}: Hispanic or Latino \code{'HoL'}
\item \strong{B03002_013}: Hispanic or Latino, white alone \code{'HoLW'}
\item \strong{B03002_014}: Hispanic or Latino, Black or African American alone \code{'HoLB'}
\item \strong{B03002_015}: Hispanic or Latino, American Indian and Alaska Native alone \code{'HoLAIAN'}
\item \strong{B03002_016}: Hispanic or Latino, Asian alone \code{'HoLA'}
\item \strong{B03002_017}: Hispanic or Latino, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone \code{'HoLNHOPI'}
\item \strong{B03002_018}: Hispanic or Latino, Some other race alone \code{'HoLSOR'}
\item \strong{B03002_019}: Hispanic or Latino, Two or more races \code{'HoLTOMR'}
\item \strong{B03002_020}: Hispanic or Latino, Two races including Some other race \code{'HoLTRiSOR'}
\item \strong{B03002_021}: Hispanic or Latino, Two races excluding Some other race, and three or more races \code{'HoLTReSOR'}
}

Use the internal \code{state} and \code{county} arguments within the \code{\link[tidycensus]{get_acs}} function to specify geographic extent of the data output.

\emph{LEx/Is} is a measure of the probability that two individuals living within a specific smaller geography (e.g., census tract) of either different (i.e., exposure) or the same (i.e., isolation) racial/ethnic subgroup(s) will interact, assuming that individuals within a smaller geography are randomly mixed. \emph{LEx/Is} is standardized with a logit transformation and centered against an expected case that all races/ethnicities are evenly distributed across a larger geography. (Note: will adjust data by 0.025 if probabilities are zero, one, or undefined. The output will include a warning if adjusted. See \code{\link[car]{logit}} for additional details.)

\emph{LEx/Is} can range from negative infinity to infinity. If \emph{LEx/Is} is zero then the estimated probability of the interaction between two people of the given subgroup(s) within a smaller geography is equal to the expected probability if the subgroup(s) were perfectly mixed in the larger geography. If \emph{LEx/Is} is greater than zero then the interaction is more likely to occur within the smaller geography than in the larger geography, and if \emph{LEx/Is} is less than zero then the interaction is less likely to occur within the smaller geography than in the larger geography. Note: the exponentiation of each \emph{LEx/Is} metric results in the odds ratio of the specific exposure or isolation of interest in a smaller geography relative to the larger geography.

Larger geographies available include state \code{geo_large = 'state'}, county \code{geo_large = 'county'}, Core Based Statistical Area \code{geo_large = 'cbsa'}, and census tract \code{geo_large = 'tract'} levels. Smaller geographies available include, county \code{geo_small = 'county'}, census tract \code{geo_small = 'tract'}, and census block group \code{geo_small = 'block group'} levels. If a larger geographical area is comprised of only one smaller geographical area (e.g., a U.S county contains only one census tract), then the \emph{LEx/Is} value returned is NA. If the larger geographical unit is Core Based Statistical Areas \code{geo_large = 'cbsa'}, only the smaller geographical units completely within a Core Based Statistical Area are considered in the \emph{LEx/Is} computation (see internal \code{\link[sf]{st_within}} function for more information) and recommend specifying all states within which the interested Core Based Statistical Areas are located using the internal \code{state} argument to ensure all appropriate smaller geographical units are included in the \emph{LEx/Is} computation.
