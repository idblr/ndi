Description: Computes various geospatial indices of socioeconomic deprivation and disparity
             in the United States. Some indices are considered "spatial" because they 
             consider the values of neighboring (i.e., adjacent) census geographies in
             their computation, while other indices are "aspatial" because they only 
             consider the value within each census geography. Two types of aspatial 
             neighborhood deprivation indices (NDI) are available: including:
             (1) based on Messer et al. (2006) <doi:10.1007/s11524-006-9094-x>
             and (2) based on Andrews et al. (2020) <doi:10.1080/17445647.2020.1750066> 
             and Slotman et al. (2022) <doi:10.1016/j.dib.2022.108002>
             who use variables chosen by Roux and Mair (2010)
             <doi:10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.05333.x>. Both are a decomposition of multiple
             demographic characteristics from the U.S. Census Bureau American Community 
             Survey 5-year estimates (ACS-5; 2006-2010 onward). Using data from the ACS-5
             (2005-2009 onward), the package can also compute indices of racial or ethnic
             residential segregation, including but limited to those discussed in Massey 
             & Denton (1988) <doi:10.1093/sf/67.2.281>, and additional indices of 
             socioeconomic disparity.
